    """v3's authoritative write boundary.

    This replaces the deleted `ActionExecutor` (#226). The shape changed with the
    runtime: v2 crossed the boundary once per action with an `ActionRequest` that
    the Checkpoint kernel resolved in one shot, while a v3 adjudication can pause
    on a check and resume through explicit player decisions — so the boundary is
    three calls rather than one.

    What did not change is why the Protocol exists: A must be able to depend on
    "there is exactly one way to change the world" without importing B's concrete
    service. Every implementation re-validates ids, revisions and request
    idempotency itself; naming a rule hands the outcome to that published rule
    (#226 §5), so a caller can never choose consequences directly.
