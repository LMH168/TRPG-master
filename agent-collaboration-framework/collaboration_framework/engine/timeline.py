"""Ordered discrete timeline: where the room may jump to next (#245 §一.1).

The whole point of the discrete model is that "what time is it next" is an
authoritative, deterministic lookup rather than arithmetic on a duration. Callers
never say *how far* to advance; they say `advance_to_next` and the timeline
answers with exactly one point.

Scope note: this module resolves **default** points only. Story temporary points
(§一.5) insert extra occurrences between two default points and are resolved by
the same `next_point_after` once RuntimeTimeTask lands — the signature is chosen
so that adding them does not change any caller.
